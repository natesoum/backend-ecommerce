## Description

This is a backend application for an ecommerce website that allows you to get all the data, post new data, update data & delete data! 

I am taking a working Express.js API and using sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This isn't a deployed application so there will be a video linked that will give you a run through of the app running through an application called Insomnia. 

For any testing, please watch the video on how to use the app! Hope you enjoy, thank you!
